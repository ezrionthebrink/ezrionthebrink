# ✨ Hey, I'm Ezri

Welcome to the corner of the internet where I build, break, and remix ideas.

I'm a project manager turned creative tinkerer — into the kind of stuff that lives between tech, design, and low-key chaos.

This GitHub is where I:
- prototype tiny tools and interactive things
- explore creative workflows, automation, and weird UI ideas
- document experiments that don’t fit anywhere else (yet)

## 🛠️ Some things you'll find here

More (actually fun) stuff coming soon.

## ✍️ Occasionally writing

- [Medium](https://medium.com/@ezrionthebrink): notes, guides, and thoughts in progress

---

building in public (kinda). stay tuned.
